# HammerVision

Making everything seem like a nail

## Goal:
Create a model to ingest threat reports, break them down into stages (really, just ATT&CK TTP), which contain observables, the lowest useful level of information.

## Use:
for now just download and `docker compose build && docker compose up -d`
